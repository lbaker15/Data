Explanation
To solve this problem I implemented a trie.  The word list is initially
looped and characters entered into the trie.  When a prefix is given, all
the children of the given prefix are returned which are then used to
return their children aka the rest of the word.

Space Complexity
O(n * m) where n is the number of words and m is the length of the words.

Time Complexity
O(n * m) where n is the number of words and m is the length of the words.
